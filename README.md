# Suicide Rates Data Cleaning

This repository focuses on the data cleaning process for a global suicide rates dataset from 2019. The goal is to preprocess and clean the raw data by addressing inconsistencies, handling missing values, and organizing it for further analysis.

## Data Source

The dataset was sourced directly from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). It includes global statistics on suicide rates, categorized by country, gender, age group, and mental health disorder prevalence. This comprehensive dataset serves as the foundation for exploring patterns and correlations related to suicide risk and mental health across diverse demographic groups.
